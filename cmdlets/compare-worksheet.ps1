Function Compare-WorkSheet {
<#
    .Synopsis
        Compares two worksheets and shows the differences.
    .Description
        This command takes two file names, one or two worksheet names and a name
        for a "key" column. It reads the worksheet from each file and decides the
        column names and builds a hashtable of the key-column values and the
        rows in which they appear.
        It then uses PowerShell's Compare-Object command to compare the sheets
        (explicitly checkingall the column names which have not been excluded).
        For the difference rows it adds the row number for the key of that row -
        we have to add the key after doing the comparison, otherwise identical
        rows at different positions in the file will not be considered a match.
        We also add the name of the file and sheet in which the difference occurs.
        If -BackgroundColor is specified the difference rows will be changed to
        that background in the orginal file.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet -Referencefile 'Server56.xlsx' -Differencefile 'Server57.xlsx'  -WorkSheetName Products -key IdentifyingNumber -ExcludeProperty Install* | Format-Table

        The two workbooks in this example contain the result of redirecting a subset
        of properties from Get-WmiObject -Class win32_product to Export-Excel.
        The command compares the "Products" pages in the two workbooks, but we
        don't want to register a difference if the software was installed on a
        different date or from a different place,  and excluding Install* removes
        InstallDate and InstallSource. This data doesn't have a "Name" column, so
        we specify the "IdentifyingNumber" column as the key.
        The results will be presented as a table.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet "Server54.xlsx" "Server55.xlsx" -WorkSheetName Services -GridView

        This time two workbooks contain the result of redirecting the command
        Get-WmiObject -Class win32_service to Export-Excel. Here the -Differencefile
        and -Referencefile parameter switches are assumed and the default setting for
        -Key ("Name") works for services. This will display the differences between
        the "Services" sheets using a grid view
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet  'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx'  -WorkSheetName Services -BackgroundColor lightGreen

        This version of the command outputs the differences between the "services" pages and  highlights any different rows in the spreadsheet files.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet 'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx'  -WorkSheetName Services -BackgroundColor lightGreen -FontColor Red -Show

        This example builds on the previous one: this time where two changed rows have
        the value in the "Name" column (the default value for -Key), this version adds
        highlighting of the changed cells in red; and then opens the Excel file.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet 'Pester-tests.xlsx' 'Pester-tests.xlsx' -WorkSheetName 'Server1','Server2' -Property "full Description","Executed","Result" -Key "full Description"

        This time the reference file and the difference file are the same file and
        two different sheets are used. Because the tests include the  machine name
        and time the test was run, the command specifies that a limited set of
        columns should be used.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet  'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx' -WorkSheetName general -Startrow 2 -Headername Label,value -Key Label -GridView -ExcludeDifferent

        The "General" page in the two workbooks has a title and two unlabelled columns
        with a row each for CPU, Memory, Domain, Disk and so on. So the command is
        told to start at row 2 in order to skip the title and given names for the
        columns: the first is "label" and the second "Value"; the label acts as the key.
        This time we are interested in those rows which are the same in both sheets,
        and the result is displayed using grid view.
        Note that grid view works best when the number of columns is small.
    .Example
        Compare-WorkSheet 'Server1.xlsx' 'Server2.xlsx' -WorkSheetName general -Startrow 2 -Headername Label,value -Key Label -BackgroundColor White -Show -AllDataBackgroundColor LightGray

        This version of the previous command highlights all the cells in LightGray
        and then sets the changed rows back to white.
        Only the unchanged rows are highlighted.
