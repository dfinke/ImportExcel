#### 4/22/2018
Thanks to the community yet again
- [ili101](https://github.com/ili101) for fixes and features
    - Removed `[PSPlot]` as OutputType. Fixes it throwing an error
- [Nasir Zubair](https://github.com/nzubair) added `ConvertEmptyStringsToNull` to the function `ConvertFrom-ExcelToSQLInsert`
    - If specified, cells without any data are replaced with NULL, instead of an empty string. This is to address behaviors in certain DBMS where an empty string is insert as 0 for INT column, instead of a NULL value.


#### 4/10/2018
-New parameter `-ReZip`. It ReZips the xlsx so it can be imported to PowerBI

Thanks to [Justin Grote](https://github.com/JustinGrote) for finding and fixing the error that Excel files created do not import to PowerBI online. Plus, thank you to [CrashM](https://github.com/CrashM) for confirming the fix.

Super helpful!

#### 3/31/2018

#### 3/14/2018
- Thank you to [James O'Neill](https://twitter.com/jamesoneill), fixed bugs with ChangeDatabase parameter which would prevent it working

####
* Added -Force to New-Alias
* Add example to set the background color of a column
* Supports excluding Row Grand Totals for PivotTables
* Allow xlsm files to be read
* Fix `Set-Column.ps1`, `Set-Row.ps1`, `SetFormat.ps1`, `formatting.ps1` **$false** and **$BorderRound**
#### 1/1/2018
* Added switch `[Switch]$NoTotalsInPivot`. Allows hiding of  the row totals in the pivot table.
Thanks you to [jameseholt](https://github.com/jameseholt) for the request.

```powershell
    get-process | where Company | select Company, Handles, WorkingSet |
        export-excel C:\temp\testColumnGrand.xlsx `
            -Show -ClearSheet  -KillExcel `
            -IncludePivotTable -PivotRows Company -PivotData @{"Handles"="average"} -NoTotalsInPivot
```

* Fixed when using certain a `ChartType` for the Pivot Table Chart, would throw an error
* Fixed - when you specify a file, and the directory does not exit, it now creates it

#### 11/23/2017
More great additions and thanks to [James O'Neill](https://twitter.com/jamesoneill)

* Added `Convert-XlRangeToImage` Gets the specified part of an Excel file and exports it as an image
* Fixed a typo in the message at line 373.
* Now catch an attempt to both clear the sheet and append to it.
* Fixed some issues when appending to sheets where the header isn't in row 1 or the data doesn't start in column 1.
* Added support for more settings when creating a pivot chart.
* Corrected a typo PivotTableName was PivotTableName in definition of New-PivotTableDefinition
* Add-ConditionalFormat and Set-Format added to the parameters so each has the choice of working more like the other.
* Added Set-Row and Set-Column - fill a formula down or across.
* Added Send-SQLDataToExcel. Insert a rowset and then call Export-Excel for ranges, charts, pivots etc.

#### 10/30/2017
Huge thanks to [James O'Neill](https://twitter.com/jamesoneill). PowerShell aficionado. He always brings a flare when working with PowerShell. This is no exception.

(Check out the examples `help Export-Excel -Examples`)

* New parameter `Package` allows an ExcelPackage object returned by `-passThru` to be passed in
* New parameter `ExcludeProperty` to remove unwanted properties without needing to go through `select-object`
* New parameter `Append` code to read the existing headers and move the insertion point below the current data
* New parameter `ClearSheet`  which removes the worksheet and any past data

* Remove any existing Pivot table before trying to [re]create it
* Check for inserting a pivot table so if `-InsertPivotChart` is specified it implies `-InsertPivotTable`

(Check out the examples `help Export-Excel -Examples`)

* New function `Export-Charts` (requires Excel to be installed) - Export Excel charts out as JPG files
* New function `Add-ConditionalFormatting` Adds conditional formatting to worksheet
* New function `Set-Format` Applies Number, font, alignment and color formatting to a range of Excel Cells
* `ColorCompletion` an argument completer for `Colors` for params across functions

I also worked out the parameters so you can do this, which is the same as passing `-Now`. It creates an Excel file name for you, does an auto fit and sets up filters.

`ps | select Company, Handles | Export-Excel`

#### 10/13/2017
Added `New-PivotTableDefinition`. You can create and wire up a PivotTable to a WorkSheet. You can also create as many PivotTable Worksheets to point a one Worksheet. Or, you create many Worksheets and many corresponding PivotTable Worksheets.

Here you can create a WorkSheet with the data from `Get-Service`. Then create four PivotTables, pointing to the data each pivoting on a different dimension and showing a different chart

```powershell
$base = @{
    SourceWorkSheet   = 'gsv'
    PivotData         = @{'Status' = 'count'}
    IncludePivotChart = $true
}

$ptd = [ordered]@{}

$ptd += New-PivotTableDefinition @base servicetype -PivotRows servicetype -ChartType Area3D
$ptd += New-PivotTableDefinition @base status -PivotRows status -ChartType PieExploded3D
$ptd += New-PivotTableDefinition @base starttype -PivotRows starttype -ChartType BarClustered3D
$ptd += New-PivotTableDefinition @base canstop -PivotRows canstop -ChartType ConeColStacked

Get-Service | Export-Excel -path $file -WorkSheetname gsv -Show -PivotTableDefinition $ptd
```

#### 10/4/2017
Thanks to https://github.com/ili101 :
- Fix Bug, Unable to find type [PSPlot]
- Fix Bug, AutoFilter with TableName create corrupted Excel file.

#### 10/2/2017
Thanks to [Jeremy Brun](https://github.com/jeremytbrun)
Fixed issues related to use of -Title parameter combined with column formatting parameters.
- [Issue #182](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/182)
- [Issue #89](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/89)

#### 9/28/2017 (Version 4.0.1)
- Added a new parameter called `Password` to import password protected files
- Added even more `Pester` tests for a more robust and bug free module
- Renamed parameter 'TopRow' to 'StartRow'
  This allows us to be more concise when new parameters ('StartColumn', ..) will be added in the future Your code will not break after the update, because we added an alias for backward compatibility

Special thanks to [robinmalik](https://github.com/robinmalik) for providing us with [the code](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/174) to implement this new feature. A high five to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1) for the implementation.

#### 9/12/2017 (Version 4.0.0)

Super thanks and hat tip to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1). There is now a new and improved `Import-Excel`, not only in functionality, but also improved readability, examples and more. Not only that, he's been running it in production in his company for a number of weeks!

*Added* `Update-FirstObjectProperties` Updates the first object to contain all the properties of the object with the most properties in the array. Check out the help.


***Breaking Changes***: Due to a big portion of the code that is rewritten some slightly different behavior can be expected from the `Import-Excel` function. This is especially true for importing empty Excel files with or without using the `TopRow` parameter. To make sure that your code is still valid, please check the examples in the help or the accompanying `Pester` test file.


Moving forward, we are planning to include automatic testing with the help of `Pester`, `Appveyor` and `Travis`. From now on any changes in the module will have to be accompanied by the corresponding `Pester` tests to avoid breakages of code and functionality. This is in preparation for new features coming down the road.

#### 7/3/2017
Thanks to [Mikkel Nordberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkelnordberg). He contributed a `ConvertTo-ExcelXlsx`. To use it, Excel needs to be installed. The function converts the older Excel file format ending in `.xls` to the new format ending in `.xlsx`.

#### 6/15/2017
Huge thank you to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1)! Refactoring of code, adding help, adding features, fixing bugs. Specifically this long outstanding one:

[Export-Excel: Numeric values not correct](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/168)

It is fantastic to work with people like `DarkLite1` in the community, to help make the module so much better. A hat to you.

Another shout out to [Damian Reeves](https://twitter.com/DamReev)! His questions turn into great features. He asked if it was possible to import an Excel worksheet and transform the data into SQL `INSERT` statements. We can now answer that question with a big YES!

```PowerShell
ConvertFrom-ExcelToSQLInsert People .\testSQLGen.xlsx
```

```
INSERT INTO People ('First', 'Last', 'The Zip') Values('John', 'Doe', '12345');
INSERT INTO People ('First', 'Last', 'The Zip') Values('Jim', 'Doe', '12345');
INSERT INTO People ('First', 'Last', 'The Zip') Values('Tom', 'Doe', '12345');
INSERT INTO People ('First', 'Last', 'The Zip') Values('Harry', 'Doe', '12345');
INSERT INTO People ('First', 'Last', 'The Zip') Values('Jane', 'Doe', '12345');
```
## Bonus Points
Use the underlying `ConvertFrom-ExcelData` function and you can use a scriptblock to format the data however you want.

```PowerShell
ConvertFrom-ExcelData .\testSQLGen.xlsx {
    param($propertyNames, $record)

    $reportRecord = @()
    foreach ($pn in $propertyNames) {
        $reportRecord += "{0}: {1}" -f $pn, $record.$pn
    }
    $reportRecord +=""
    $reportRecord -join "`r`n"
}
```
Generates

```
First: John
Last: Doe
The Zip: 12345

First: Jim
Last: Doe
The Zip: 12345

First: Tom
Last: Doe
The Zip: 12345

First: Harry
Last: Doe
The Zip: 12345

First: Jane
Last: Doe
The Zip: 12345
```

#### 2/2/2017
Thank you to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1) for more updates
* TableName with parameter validation, throws an error when the TableName:
    - Starts with something else then a letter
    - Is NULL or empty
    - Contains spaces
- Numeric parsing now uses `CurrentInfo` to use the system settings

#### 2/14/2017
Big thanks to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1) for some great updates
* `-DataOnly` switch added to `Import-Excel`. When used it will only generate objects for rows that contain text values, not for empty rows or columns.

* `Get-ExcelWorkBookInfo` - retrieves information of an Excel workbook.
```
        Get-ExcelWorkbookInfo .\Test.xlsx

#### 12/22/2016
- Added `-Now` switch. This short cuts the process, automatically creating a temp file and enables the `-Show`, `-AutoFilter`, `-AutoSize` switches.

```PowerShell
Get-Process | Select Company, Handles | Export-Excel -Now
```

- Added ScriptBlocks for coloring cells. Check out [Examples](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/tree/master/Examples/FormatCellStyles)

```PowerShell
Get-Process |
    Select-Object Company,Handles,PM, NPM|
    Export-Excel $xlfile -Show  -AutoSize -CellStyleSB {
        param(
            $workSheet,
            $totalRows,
            $lastColumn
        )

        Set-CellStyle $workSheet 1 $LastColumn Solid Cyan

        foreach($row in (2..$totalRows | Where-Object {$_ % 2 -eq 0})) {
            Set-CellStyle $workSheet $row $LastColumn Solid Gray
        }

        foreach($row in (2..$totalRows | Where-Object {$_ % 2 -eq 1})) {
            Set-CellStyle $workSheet $row $LastColumn Solid LightGray
        }
    }
```

Big bug fix for version 3.0 PowerShell folks!

This technique fails in 3.0 and works in 4.0 and later.
```PowerShell
$m="substring"
"hello".$m(2,1)
```

Adding `.invoke` works in 3.0 and later.

```PowerShell
$m="substring"
"hello".$m.invoke(2,1)
```

A ***big thank you*** to [DarkLite1](https://github.com/DarkLite1) for adding the help to Export-Excel.

Added `-HeaderRow` parameter. Sometimes the heading does not start in Row 1.

Fixes [Export-Excel generates corrupt Excel file](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/46)

#### 10/15/2015

`Import-Excel` has a new parameter `NoHeader`. If data in the sheet does not have headers and you don't want to supply your own, `Import-Excel` will generate the property name.

`Import-Excel` now returns `.Value` rather than `.Text`

Merged ValidateSet for Encoding and Extension. Thank you [Irwin Strachan](https://github.com/irwins).

Export-Excel can now handle data that is **not** an object

	echo a b c 1 $true 2.1 1/1/2015 | Export-Excel c:\temp\test.xlsx -Show
Or

	dir -Name | Export-Excel c:\temp\test.xlsx -Show

**Hide worksheets**
Got a great request from [forensicsguy20012004](https://github.com/forensicsguy20012004) to hide worksheets. You create a few pivot tables, generate charts and then pivot table worksheets don't need to be visible.

`Export-Excel` now has a `-HideSheet` parameter that takes and array of worksheet names and hides them.

##### Example
Here, you create four worksheets named `PM`,`Handles`,`Services` and `Files`.

The last line creates the `Files` sheet and then hides the `Handles`,`Services` sheets.

	$p = Get-Process

	$p|select company, pm | Export-Excel $xlFile -WorkSheetname PM
	$p|select company, handles| Export-Excel $xlFile -WorkSheetname Handles
	Get-Service| Export-Excel $xlFile -WorkSheetname Services

	dir -File | Export-Excel $xlFile -WorkSheetname Files -Show -HideSheet Handles, Services


**Note** There is a bug in EPPlus that does not let you hide the first worksheet created. Hopefully it'll resolved soon.

#### 9/11/2015

Added Conditional formatting. See [TryConditional.ps1](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/blob/master/TryConditional.ps1) as an example.

* Now import Excel sheets even if the file is open in Excel. Thank you [Francois Lachance-Guillemette](https://github.com/francoislg)

#### 7/09/2015
* For -PivotRows you can pass a `hashtable` with the name of the property and the type of calculation. `Sum`, `Average`, `Max`, `Min`, `Product`, `StdDev`, `StdDevp`, `Var`, `Varp`

```PowerShell
Get-Service |
	Export-Excel "c:\temp\test.xlsx" `
		-Show `
		-IncludePivotTable `
		-PivotRows status `
		-PivotData @{status='count'}
```

#### 6/16/2015 (Thanks [Justin](https://github.com/zippy1981))
* Improvements to PivotTable overwriting
* Added two parameters to Export-Excel
	* RangeName - Turns the data piped to Export-Excel into a named range.
	* TableName  - Turns the data piped to Export-Excel into an excel table.

Examples

	Get-Process|Export-Excel foo.xlsx -Verbose -IncludePivotTable -TableName "Processes" -Show
	Get-Process|Export-Excel foo.xlsx -Verbose -IncludePivotTable -RangeName "Processes" -Show


#### 5/25/2015
* Fixed null header problem

#### 5/17/2015
* Added three parameters:
	* FreezeTopRow - Freezes the first row of the data
	* AutoFilter - Enables filtering for the data in the sheet
	* BoldTopRow - Bolds the top row of data, the column headers

Example

	Get-CimInstance win32_service |
		select state, accept*, start*, caption |
		Export-Excel test.xlsx -Show -BoldTopRow -AutoFilter -FreezeTopRow -AutoSize

#### 5/4/2015
* Published to PowerShell Gallery. In PowerShell v5 use	`Find-Module importexcel` then `Find-Module importexcel | Install-Module`


#### 4/27/2015
* datetime properties were displaying as ints, now are formatted

#### 4/25/2015
* Now you can create multiple Pivot tables in one pass
	* Thanks to [pscookiemonster](https://twitter.com/pscookiemonster), he submitted a repro case to the EPPlus CodePlex project and got it fixed

#### Example

	$ps = ps

	$ps |
	    Export-Excel .\testExport.xlsx  -WorkSheetname memory `
	        -IncludePivotTable -PivotRows Company -PivotData PM `
	        -IncludePivotChart -ChartType PieExploded3D
	$ps |
	    Export-Excel .\testExport.xlsx  -WorkSheetname handles `
	        -IncludePivotTable -PivotRows Company -PivotData Handles `
	        -IncludePivotChart -ChartType PieExploded3D -Show

#### 4/20/2015
* Included and embellished [Claus Nielsen](https://github.com/Claustn) function to take all sheets in an Excel file workbook and create a text file for each `ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet`
* Renamed `Export-MultipleExcelSheets` to `ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet`

#### 4/13/2015
* You can add a title to the Excel "Report" `Title`, `TitleFillPattern`, `TitleBold`, `TitleSize`, `TitleBackgroundColor`
	* Thanks to [Irwin Strachan](http://pshirwin.wordpress.com) for this and other great suggestions, testing and more


#### 4/10/2015
* Renamed `AutoFitColumns` to `AutoSize`
* Implemented `Export-MultipleExcelSheets`
* Implemented `-Password` for a worksheet
* Replaced `-Force` switch with `-NoClobber` switch
* Added examples for `Get-Help`
* If Pivot table is requested, that sheet becomes the tab selected

#### 4/8/2015
* Implemented exporting data to **named sheets** via the -WorkSheetname parameter.

Examples
-
`gsv | Export-Excel .\test.xlsx -WorkSheetname Services`

`dir -file | Export-Excel .\test.xlsx -WorkSheetname Files`

`ps | Export-Excel .\test.xlsx -WorkSheetname Processes -IncludePivotTable -Show -PivotRows Company -PivotData PM`

#### Convert (All or Some) Excel Sheets to Text files

Reads each sheet in TestSheets.xlsx and outputs it to the data directory as the sheet name with the extension .txt

    ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet .\TestSheets.xlsx .\data

Reads and outputs sheets like Sheet10 and Sheet20 form TestSheets.xlsx and outputs it to the data directory as the sheet name with the extension .txt

	ConvertFrom-ExcelSheet .\TestSheets.xlsx .\data sheet?0

#### Example Adding a Title
You can set the pattern, size and of if the title is bold.

	$p=@{
	    Title = "Process Report as of $(Get-Date)"
	    TitleFillPattern = "LightTrellis"
	    TitleSize = 18
	    TitleBold = $true

		Path  = "$pwd\testExport.xlsx"
	    Show = $true
	    AutoSize = $true
	}

	Get-Process |
	    Where Company | Select Company, PM |
	    Export-Excel @p

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/master/images/Title.png)

#### Example Export-MultipleExcelSheets
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/master/images/ExportMultiple.gif)

	$p = Get-Process

	$DataToGather = @{
	    PM        = {$p|select company, pm}
	    Handles   = {$p|select company, handles}
	    Services  = {gsv}
	    Files     = {dir -File}
	    Albums    = {(Invoke-RestMethod http://www.dougfinke.com/PowerShellfordevelopers/albums.js)}
	}

	Export-MultipleExcelSheets -Show -AutoSize .\testExport.xlsx $DataToGather



***NOTE*** If the sheet exists when using *-WorkSheetname* parameter, it will be deleted and then added with the new data.

## Known Issues

* Using `-IncludePivotTable`, if that pivot table name exists, you'll get an error.
	* Investigating a solution
	* *Workaround* delete the Excel file first, then do the export
