## DESCRIPTION
This command takes two file names, one or two worksheet names and a name for a "key" column.

It reads the worksheet from each file and decides the column names and builds a hashtable of the key-column values and the
rows in which they appear.

It then uses PowerShell's Compare-Object command to compare the sheets (explicitly checking all the column names which have not been excluded).

For the difference rows it adds the row number for the key of that row - we have to add the key after doing the comparison, otherwise identical rows at different positions in the file will not be considered a match.

We also add the name of the file and sheet in which the difference occurs.

If -BackgroundColor is specified the difference rows will be changed to that background in the orginal file.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet -Referencefile 'Server56.xlsx' -Differencefile 'Server57.xlsx' -WorkSheetName Products -key IdentifyingNumber -ExcludeProperty Install* | Format-Table
```

The two workbooks in this example contain the result of redirecting a subset of properties from Get-WmiObject -Class win32_product to Export-Excel.

The command compares the "Products" pages in the two workbooks, but we don't want to register a difference if the software was installed on a different date or from a different place, and excluding Install* removes InstallDate and InstallSource.

This data doesn't have a "Name" column, so we specify the "IdentifyingNumber" column as the key.

The results will be presented as a table.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet "Server54.xlsx" "Server55.xlsx" -WorkSheetName Services -GridView
```

This time two workbooks contain the result of redirecting the command Get-WmiObject -Class win32_service to Export-Excel.

Here the -Differencefile and -Referencefile parameter switches are assumed and the default setting for -Key ("Name") works for services.

This will display the differences between the "Services" sheets using a grid view

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet 'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx' -WorkSheetName Services -BackgroundColor lightGreen
```

This version of the command outputs the differences between the "services" pages and highlights any different rows in the spreadsheet files.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet 'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx' -WorkSheetName Services -BackgroundColor lightGreen -FontColor Red -Show
```

This example builds on the previous one: this time where two changed rows have the value in the "Name" column (the default value for -Key), this version adds highlighting of the changed cells in red; and then opens the Excel file.

### EXAMPLE 5
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet 'Pester-tests.xlsx' 'Pester-tests.xlsx' -WorkSheetName 'Server1','Server2' -Property "full Description","Executed","Result" -Key "full Description"
```

This time the reference file and the difference file are the same file and two different sheets are used.

Because the tests include the machine name and time the test was run, the command specifies that a limited set of columns should be used.

### EXAMPLE 6
```
PS\> Compare-WorkSheet 'Server54.xlsx' 'Server55.xlsx' -WorkSheetName general -Startrow 2 -Headername Label,value -Key Label -GridView -ExcludeDifferent
```

The "General" page in the two workbooks has a title and two unlabelled columns with a row each for CPU, Memory, Domain, Disk and so on.

So the command is told to start at row 2 in order to skip the title and given names for the columns: the first is "label" and the second "Value"; the label acts as the key.

This time we are interested in those rows which are the same in both sheets, and the result is displayed using grid view.

Note that grid view works best when the number of columns is small.

### EXAMPLE 7
```
PS\>Compare-WorkSheet 'Server1.xlsx' 'Server2.xlsx' -WorkSheetName general -Startrow 2 -Headername Label,value -Key Label -BackgroundColor White -Show -AllDataBackgroundColor LightGray
```

This version of the previous command highlights all the cells in LightGray and then sets the changed rows back to white.

Only the unchanged rows are highlighted.
