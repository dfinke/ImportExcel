# Add-WorkSheet

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a worksheet to an existing workbook.

## SYNTAX

### Package
```
Add-WorkSheet [-ExcelPackage] <ExcelPackage> [-WorksheetName <String>] [-ClearSheet] [-MoveToStart] [-MoveToEnd] [-MoveBefore <Object>] [-MoveAfter <Object>] [-Activate] [-CopySource <ExcelWorksheet>] [-NoClobber] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### WorkBook
```
Add-WorkSheet -ExcelWorkbook <ExcelWorkbook> [-WorksheetName <String>] [-ClearSheet] [-MoveToStart] [-MoveToEnd] [-MoveBefore <Object>] [-MoveAfter <Object>] [-Activate] [-CopySource <ExcelWorksheet>] [-NoClobber] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
If the named worksheet already exists, the -Clearsheet parameter decides whether it should be deleted and a new one returned,
or if not specified the existing sheet will be returned.

By default the sheet is created at the end of the work book, the -MoveXXXX switches allow the sheet to be \[re\]positioned at the start or before or after another sheet.

A new sheet will only be made the default sheet when excel opens if -Activate is specified.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS\> $WorksheetActors = $ExcelPackage | Add-WorkSheet -WorkSheetname Actors
```

$ExcelPackage holds an Excel package object (returned by Open-ExcelPackage, or Export-Excel -passthru).
This command will add a sheet named 'Actors', or return the sheet if it exists, and the result is stored in $WorkSheetActors.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS\> $WorksheetActors = Add-WorkSheet -ExcelPackage $ExcelPackage -WorkSheetname "Actors" -ClearSheet -MoveToStart
```

This time the Excel package object is passed as a parameter instead of piped.

If the 'Actors' sheet already exists it is deleted and re-created.

The new sheet will be created last in the workbook, and -MoveToStart Moves it to the start.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS\> $null = Add-WorkSheet -ExcelWorkbook $wb -WorkSheetname $DestinationName -CopySource $sourceWs -Activate
```

This time a workbook is used instead of a package, and a worksheet is copied - $SourceWs is a worksheet object, which can come from the same workbook or a different one.

Here the new copy of the data is made the active sheet when the workbook is opened.
